# llm-router
a simplified OpenRouter-style system where users can run the same prompt against multiple LLM providers, compare responses, and select preferred outputs. The system uses a clean adapter pattern, stores experiments and predictions in a relational database, and is designed with production-grade concerns like logging, indexing, and extensibility.
